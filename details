=>In JavaScript, an array is a data structure that is used to store and organize multiple values. Arrays can hold various data types, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.

Object:

=>In JavaScript, an object is a complex data type that allows you to store and organize data in a key-value pair format. Objects are used to represent real-world entities, and they can contain properties and methods. 

What is an Object Literal?

=>An object literal is a way to create and define an object in JavaScript using curly braces {}. It's like a container that can hold related information.

let person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Engineer'
};

You can access the properties of an object using dot notation or square bracket notation:

console.log(person.name); // Output: 'John'
console.log(person['age']); // Output: 30

You can also add new properties or modify existing ones:

person.city = 'New York'; // Adding a new property
person.age = 31; // Modifying an existing property
